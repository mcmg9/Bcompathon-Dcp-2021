# Bcompathon-Dcp-2021
Submission for the Bcompathon 2021 Dcp project

The idea for the project was a proof-of-concept for a distributed bitcoin miner using the bitcoin-miner module.

Although it was not properly implemented to be used with dcp, there is a demo of the bitcoin miner and how it works.

Note: these were made using v3 of dcp, if you need to run it with updated dcp, remove the '-v3' from the first line at the top of the files

install bitcoin-miner: npm install bitcoin-miner

run: node index.js
